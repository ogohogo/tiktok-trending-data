# tiktok-trending-data
Repo that scrapes discovery data from TikTok!

This repo scrapes TikTok's Web Discovery API every 1 hour and makes commit whenever it detects any change.
It scrapes data from "t.tiktok.com", there are 2 more domains which show different data. I'll add it on request.

Inspired by antiops' TikTok Trending Data (https://github.com/antiops/tiktok-trending-data).

# Features:

* Avatars available in 4 resolutions and 2 extensions (total of 8)
* Avatars never expire! (TikTok made user avatars expire after 24 hours)
* Nice JSON formatting
* Shows trending users, hashtags and songs!
